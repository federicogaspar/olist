# Olist 2016–2018 — Analytics Summary

## Key Insights: Delivery Performance vs Customer Satisfaction

### 1. **Clear Pain Threshold at 3-4 Days** 📉
- **1-3 days late**: 3.29 review score (tolerable range)
- **4+ days late**: Score drops to ~2.1 and remains consistently low
- **Business Impact**: There is a critical cliff at 3-4 days delay where customer tolerance breaks

### 2. **Expectation Management Paradox** 🎯

**Counter-intuitive finding**: Fast promises that fail actually hurt LESS than slow promises that fail. This suggests customers are more forgiving when they had high initial expectations.

### 3. **Predictable Seasonal Capacity Crisis** ⚠️
- **November**: 87.8% on-time rate (vs 97% average) - Clear Black Friday effect
- **Summer months**: Consistently worse performance (91.7% on-time)
- **Winter**: 96.7% on-time rate - Best performing season
- **Opportunity**: 10% performance drop in November is predictable and preventable

### 4. **Early Delivery Diminishing Returns** 💸
- **21+ days early**: 4.29 review score
- **Normal timing**: ~4.25-4.30 review score
- **ROI Analysis**: Marginal improvement (0.02-0.04 points) doesn't justify over-investment in speed

## Business Recommendations

1. **Focus resources on the 4-day threshold** - Prevent >3 days delay at all costs
2. **November capacity planning** - Scale operations proactively for predictable seasonal demand
3. **Promise strategy optimization** - Fast promises are more resilient to failures than slow promises
4. **Stop over-delivering on speed** - Reallocate resources from speed to reliability

## Key Metrics
- Overall delivery satisfaction correlation: **-0.346** (moderate negative)
- Baseline on-time performance: **93.4%** (strong foundation)
- Critical satisfaction threshold: **3-4 days delay**
- Seasonal performance variance: **9.9 percentage points** (Winter vs Summer)
